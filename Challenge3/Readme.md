**Question3**
We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs:

object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c

object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a

Hints - We would like to see some tests. A quick read to help you along the way. We would expect it in any other language apart from elixir.

**Steps to Execute** 

1. Install Python3 on the server or system where you execute these python scripts
2. Install pip and install the pytest package to do some testing.
   ''' 
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    pip3 install pytest
   '''
